## Y axis
- less belt length is needed than the standard E3Max. Re-crimping the belt is necessary 

## Y axis rear notes

- The stepper attached pulley must be removed to tighten a mounting bolt placed behind the pulley.

- The motor mount bracket is very close to the build plate. It is possible that the insulation underneath the bed can catch on the bracket and pull it back. I recommend using kapton tape to stick this down to make this less likely. 

- I have concerns of heat related part failure, or parts becoming loose due to printed parts compressing and losing tension over time due to extra heat in the area.


## Y Axis Front

- ender3v2 switchwire conversion issue: Pulley bolt is an M5 bolt, the E3Max uses a M3 bolt. Modifying the adjustable carriage is needed to use this hardware. Alternatively, purchasing an idler pulley with a larger internal diameter would work.

- Slipping the belt into the printer bed plate can be difficult as there is little slack when the Y-Axis is fully assembled. Removing the front assembly, leaving the idler-pulley part attached, and bringing the bed forward makes this much easier to access and gives adequate slack.

- The current offset of the Idler body part is about 4cm shorter than the standard bracket. This reduces the amount of movement the y axis can slide on, resulting in ~4cm of build area being removed on this axis.
