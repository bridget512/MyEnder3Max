![alt text](https://github.com/bridget512/MyEnder3Max/blob/main/Modifications/BZ-E3M-V1/Progress%20Pictures/asmRear.jpg?raw=true)

## Components Used:
- 2x Voron M4 Extruder Kits
    - Uses some of the parts (Bearings, some screws, 80t drive gear pulley and screws).
    - Spare extruder gears are great when printing CF filaments as they get worn down! ;)
    - Future versions will use more of the parts in the kit.
- 2x 60mm x 5mm D-Shafts (Voron 2.4 Z-Drive/D-Axis Kit)
    - Currently using these shafts instead of the extruder kit shafts due to the shaft notches being in awkward spots. 
- 2x 30mm x 5mm dowel pins
    - These are used for the top pulleys.
- 28x 5mmID x 1mm spacers
    - Future versions will use printed spacers.
- Pulleys:
    - 2x Idler Pulley - GT2, 20 Teeth, 5mm Bore, 6mm Width .
    - 2x Timing Pulley Sprocket - GT2, 20 Teeth, 5mm Bore, 6mm Width (+2 if printing 80t reduction gear).
- Screws:
    - 6x M3x6
    - 4x M3x8
    - 4x M3x10
    - 6x M3x12 (2 from M4 Kit)
    - 4x M3x16 (M4 Kit)
    - 4x M3x30 (M4 Kit)
    - 2x M3x35
    - 3x M5x40
- Belt: 2m GT2 Gates 6mm wide

# BZ-V1 Assembly Notes 
Please note that this is not a completed modification and is very much a mixture of parts. 

The following notes were taken when assembling the kit and will be used to make modifications to the parts for future revisions.

## Material and Settings
 - Material: ASA - Purple Siddament. 
 - Temps: H:255c, B: 98.
 - Part: 4 Walls, 5 Tops/Bottoms, 40% infill.
 - Speeds: 60mm/s walls/infill, 40mm/s default.
 - Accelerations: 1500-3000.

## BZ-MP (Motor Plates)
- Access slot for pulley should be relocated to the side (bottom access is difficult)
- Mating Faces to extrusion must be filed flat due to print orientation
- Slight movement from assembly body once mounted. This is fine.
 ### Components (Per Side)
  - 2pc M3x12, 1pc M3x6
  - Spacers 5 + 5 + 4

## BZ-M4 & BZ-R (V-Wheel Plates)
 - V-Roller Holes and Nut too small by ~0.08ish
 - Heat-Set threads not deep enough by 0.8 - 1.0mm.
 - Belt adjuster captive nut hole too small in all directions, including inner hex shape.
 - Fillet on belt adjuster causing overhang issues, make them square.
 ### Components
  - 3pc M5x40
  - 8.4mm worth of spacers (they're usually not accurate, I have 9pcs of 1mm spacers that measure 8.42mm)
  - Belt Adjuster: 1pc M3x16, 2pc M3x10

## BZ-Idlers
 - Extrusion sizing could be slightly bigger for easier fitment.
 ### Components (Per Side)
  - 1pc 30mm x 5mm dowel pin
  - 2pc M3x6, 2pc M3x8
  - 4pc M3 T-Slot Nuts

## BZ-M4-Risers
 - M3 hole too small. 

## BZ-M4-Riser-CableClamps
 - Slight layer drooping on M3 hole from overhang due to print orientation. Hole needs to be filled or enlarged in the model.
 ### Components (Per Riser)
  - 1pc M3x35

## Belt Used
- 198.5mm - 6mm - GT2 Gates
